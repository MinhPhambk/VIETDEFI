**Summerize:
To learn something new --> Spaced Repetition Scheduling 
	--> How to optimize?
		--> SuperMemo 
		--> FSRS (other optimization algorithm like SuperMemo)
	--> Choose?
		--> SuperMemo: undefined the format of input between v2 and v18 , open source is written in unknwow language (Swift, Go, ..)
			--> Seem difficult to demo
		--> FSRS: a demo founded and clearly input, output

**Be doing and will do next:
- Read function demo of FSRS --> demo --> to extract how a card was recalled to learn by time
- Try to improve (not really confident, need to time to research)
