Done: - simulate for schedule app
      - clear about input, output of both model and a simulator example

Not yet: - training process of model (need more time to research ...)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
input model: ...
output model: ra, rb, rc, rd, fa, fb, fc, fd (policy when init new word's state)
	      ivl-1, ivl-.... (policy when process reviewed word's state)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
simulator app:
input: word and it's difficulty
learner:
	each day learn word: new words and reviewed words
	bot will update: difficulty, next day to review, p_recall, 
			 halflife (related to the strength of memory),
			 r_history, t_history,
			 and some which is not really important
	      --> update whenever the learner complete to review a word
	      --> feature: realtime
