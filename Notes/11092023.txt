Dataset maimemo:
	*The logs are uploaded to the remote after the learner has completed all the reviews for the day
	- format of a record: u, w, t, r
		-- u: id of user
		-- w: word
		-- t: time that user meets the word w
		-- r: 0 if user forgets and 1 otherwise
	--> analysis (status: ok)
	--> preprocessing ETL (status: ok)
	--> train model (status: not yet, being in process to reivew)

Model (status: not yet, being in process to reivew):
	- Data input:
		-- a record's format: Difficulty-Halflife-P(recall) --> DHP model
		Difficulty: user choose
		Halflife-P: can be calculate from r, t\

Problem: What is the output of DHP model?
